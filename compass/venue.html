<p>A venue for a NodeCopter event should ideally meet the following requirements:

</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Flying area</strong>: a separate flying area is great to play
around with drones, try out the programs and should prevent drones from
crashing into people.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>High ceiling</strong>: a flying area with a low ceiling doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense
when there are programmed NodeCopters flying around. Ideal would be a minimum
height of 4 meters (13 feet).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Great hacking space</strong>: attendees are going to program their drones, so be
sure to provide an area where they can sit down and hack.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stable WiFi</strong>: it&#39;s safe to say that there will be on average a minimum
of two WiFi-capable devices per attendee (computer, phone, tablet, ...). And
every drone that is powered on will open its own wi-fi. Be sure your venue&#39;s
WiFi can handle this!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Electricity</strong>: be sure there are enough power sockets and enough power splitters.
People need to recharge their computers and their phones, and you need too hook
up the rechargers for the batteries somewhere. You don&#39;t want to run out of fully
charged batteries when people are doing crazy stuff with their drones!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Projector and screen</strong>: for the introductory talk at the beginning of a
NodeCopter event a projector and a screen are really great. And when it&#39;s time
for the demos most attendes will need a projector to show of what they built.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="venue-berlin"><a href="#venue-berlin">Berlin</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/venue-small.jpg" alt="NodeCopter Berlin Venue">

</p>
<p><strong>Pro</strong>:

</p>
<ul>
<li>The abandoned public swimming baths were <strong>huge</strong>! There was plenty of space
to fly around!</li>
<li>The hacking area was totally separated from the flying area: attendees were
sitting besides the empty pool in which the drones where flying.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contra</strong>:

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The electricity in that old building wasn&#39;t the best. We essentially had a
couple of power sockets and needed loads of power splitters to make this work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It was cold since it takes a lot of time and effort to heat up such a huge
hall at the beginning of October.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="venue-dublin"><a href="#venue-dublin">Dublin</a></h3>

<p><img src="/img/dublin-venue-small.jpg" alt="NodeCopter Dublin Venue">

</p>
<p><strong>Pro</strong>:

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The hacking spaces were really comfortable: you had a choice between
working at a normal desk or sitting on a couch.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Separate flying and hacking areas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contra</strong>:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though the venue had high ceilings it also had some metal bars on the
ceilings, which a lot of NodeCopters hit eventually.</li>
</ul>
